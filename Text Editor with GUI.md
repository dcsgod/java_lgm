This is a simple text editor implemented in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing. The text editor allows users to enter, change, store, and print text. It also includes a file menu to open, save, close, and print files for future reference. Additionally, it has an edit menu to cut, copy, and paste texts. The "Save and Submit" button allows users to close the file after saving the data.
